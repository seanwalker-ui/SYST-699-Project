To make the drones move more efficiently and faster toward the target location:

1. Increase the speed of movement: The action generation mechanism should scale the movement toward the target more aggressively.
2. Reward shaping: The reward mechanism should encourage faster movement toward the target by giving more negative rewards for being further away from the target and rewarding closeness more.
3. Proportional controller tuning: Adjust the proportional controller to ensure drones move in a more efficient manner.

Make a new class, SwarmController, which will handle the logic of keeping the drones in a swarm while moving them towards a randomly generated target location. 
This class will control the movement of the drones, ensure they stay together in the swarm formation, and update their positions towards the target.

The key steps are:
Generate a random target: The drones will move towards this target.
Maintain swarm formation: The drones will move towards the target while staying in a swarm using a simple force-based model (i.e., attraction towards the target and attraction to the swarm center).
Display everything: Both the drones and the target will be visualized in the pygame window, with the drones labeled by ID and the target labeled as well.

New statement:
"Create a new class in the python script to have the drone swarm move to a random target location that is labeled on the virtual display. 
 To do this, I want to make sure that the drones are trained to converge in the swarm position and travel to the labeled target location. 
 This can be done by increasing the reward function to make the drones more likely to travel to the target location in a swarm. 
 Log all of this data in the CustomWrapper class. Here is my code for run_multiagent_trpo.py;"

 Important: Modify the reward function to give higher rewards when drones converge and move toward the target location in CustomMonitor. Add the distance between the drones and the target as 
            part of the reward function. The closer they are to the target, the higher the reward.
